## 🧠 Key Backend Concepts

### 🗃 Database Design
- Relational schema modeling.
- Normalization and performance indexing.
- ORM usage and raw SQL where needed.

### 🧵 Asynchronous Programming
- Use of async views in Django.
- Task management via Celery workers.

### 💨 Caching Strategies
- In-memory caching with Redis.
- Queryset and view-level caching for performance.

### 🌐 API Design
